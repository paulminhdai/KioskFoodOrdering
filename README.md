# Kiosk Food Ordering

Restaurants started to use different methods to minimize human contact such as delivering food, taking phone orders for pick-up, or having outdoor dine-in. A solution would be creating a kiosk-like system for customers to order food, pay, wait, and leave happily with their foods. This will open another route to order food, and it will prevent additional interaction.
